In 2007, reports surfaced that Google was planning the release of its own mobile phone, possibly a competitor to Apple's iPhone.The project, called Android, turned out not to be a phone but an operating system for mobile devices, which Google acquired and then released as an open source project under the Apache 2.0 license.Google provides a software development kit for developers so applications can be created to be run on Android-based phones. In September 2008, T-Mobile released the G1, the first Android-based phone.
Google released the seventh major version of the Android operating system in August 2016.Android is the world's most widely used operating system, with over 1.4 billion active users in September 2015.However, Android's platform fragmentation (millions of devices from hundreds of manufacturers who each design their own version of Android) means that the operating system suffers significant issues with security vulnerabilities due to a lack of updates and support.</p>

	Following the launch of the Chrome browser in 2008, Google introduced Chrome OS in 2009, described as a new, open-source, lightweight operating system based entirely around the browser, and targeted at netbooks.</p>
	<p>Chrome OS is an operating system designed by Google that is based on the Linux kernel and uses the Google Chrome web browser as its principal user interface. As a result, Chrome OS primarily supports web applications.</p>
	<p>Chrome OS has an integrated media player and file manager. It supports Chrome Apps, which resemble native applications, as well as remote access to the desktop. A few Android applications have been available for the operating system since 2014. Reception was initially skeptical, with some observers arguing that a browser running on any operating system was functionally equivalent. As more Chrome OS machines have entered the market, the operating system is now seldom evaluated apart from the hardware that runs it.</p>
	<p>Chrome OS is only available pre-installed on hardware from Google manufacturing partners. An open source equivalent, Chromium OS, can be compiled from downloaded source code.</p>

	In 2011, the Chromebook was introduced, described as a "new&nbsp;kind&nbsp;of&nbsp;computer" running Chrome OS, with the first Chromebooks coming from Samsung and Acer.</p>
	<p>A Chromebook is a laptop running the Linux-based Chrome OS as its operating system. The devices were originally designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with most applications and data residing in "the cloud". The original Chromebook was an example of a thin client.However, since its original release, Google Apps (gmail, docs, (spread)sheets, and slides) were rewritten to run in offline mode, and Android Apps are being made available on Chromebooks, which makes the platform more general-purpose than a typical thin client.</p>
	<p>In addition to laptop models, a desktop version, called a Chromebox, was introduced in May 2012, and an "all-in-one" device was introduced in January 2014, by LG Electronics.</p>
	<p>At Google I/O 2016, it was announced that Android applications would be available to run on supported Chromebooks, via the Google Play Store; that will result in having two app stores in Chrome OS.</p>

The suite also consists of Google Forms (survey software), Google Drawings (diagramming software) and Google Fusion Tables (database manager; experimental.</p>
	<p>While Google Docs has been criticized for traditionally lacking the functionality of Microsoft Office, it has received praise for its simplicity, ease of collaboration and frequent product updates.
